# VBA-JScript-Host
All VBA IActiveScript interface and implementation (to host jscript9.dll). No type library, no registration, no elevated permissions.

I was working on this several years ago when Wqweto published a better version (https://github.com/wqweto/VBTixyLand). If for some unfortunate reason you need something like this, you should use his version.
